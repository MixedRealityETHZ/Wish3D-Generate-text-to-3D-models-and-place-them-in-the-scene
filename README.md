# Wish3D
 Wish3D is a Mixed Reality (MR) application designed for the Magic Leap 2 Headset. Wish3D utilises advanced speech recognition and 3D generation technologies to enable users to create and interact with 3D objects through voice commands in a Mixed Reality environment. Users can engage with the produced objects within the environment, having the ability to rotate, relocate, adjust scale, and throw objects in MR. Notably, objects are capable of interacting with one another through collisions and aligns with the principles of physics governed by gravity.

 To run the application, you will requirement following:
 1. Magic Leap 2 glasses
 2. Unity setup to deploy project to Magic Leap 2
 3. Server where you can run APIs

There are two folders here:
1. api
2. unity_project

api folder contains codebase to run API on a server. Refer to README.md of api folder to know more on how to setup and run the Wish3D API. 

unity_project folder contains codebase and unity project of Wish3D. Refer to README.md of unity_project to know more on how to setup and deploy Wish3D on magic leap 2 glasses.
